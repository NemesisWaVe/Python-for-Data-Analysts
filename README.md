# A Data Analyst's Notebook: Python Essentials 🐍

### 👋 Hey there\!

Welcome\! I put this repository together to share foundational Python concepts and code snippets that I've found most useful in my data analysis work. My goal wasn't to create another dense, technical manual, but a simple, practical, and human-friendly starting point.

> Think of this as a collection of notes—the kind of stuff I wish someone had shown me when I was just getting started.

### 💡 My Philosophy for this Repo

  * **Practical First**: The examples here are designed to mirror real-world tasks.
  * **Clarity Over Complexity**: We'll skip the confusing jargon and focus on what's important.
  * **Beyond the Basics**: I've included a file on common data cleaning "gotchas" that you'll inevitably run into.

### 🚀 What's Inside?

The repository is broken down into a few key Python files:

1.  `introPython.py`: Journey Starts! Lots of fun ahead learning basic concepts of python.
2.  `func&Classes.py`: A quick look at why and how to use functions and classes to keep your code from becoming a tangled mess.Your first step into NumPy for fast and efficient math on large datasets.
3.  `NumPy-intro.py`: Your first step into NumPy for fast and efficient math on large datasets. Complete overview how NumPy works.
4.

### 🛠️ How to Use This

1.  **Get the files**: Clone or download this repository to your computer.
2.  **Install the tools**: Open your terminal, navigate to this folder, and run the command below. This installs all the necessary libraries.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Explore and experiment**: Open the `.py` files in a code editor (like VS Code). Read the comments, run the code, and most importantly, **change things**. Break the code and see what happens. That's the best way to learn.

Happy analyzing\! 🎉
